- Use functional programming over object-oriented-programming designs, especially if OpenAI Agent SDK doesn't absolutely require it.
- The package name is openai_agents, but for imports use **agents**
- Study the patterns and implementations used in the official documentation
- Ruff is installed in the virtual environment (using uv). On every edit, run the file thorough ruff (ruff check) and (ruff format) for indentifying lint and formatting issues - resolve them
- Don't run the main.py file, always ask user to run it manually
- Don't install any package or dependency without getting a confirmation from user
- Don't create the requirements.txt file as we are using uv as the python package manager
- Before implementing anything with the OpenAI Agents SDK, always perform a web search tool call to the official documentation at https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python
